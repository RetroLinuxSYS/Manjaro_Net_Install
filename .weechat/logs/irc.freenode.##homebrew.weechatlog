2014-11-04 14:55:18	jdv79	does anyone else find the 12 mins per judging to be a bit aggressive?
2014-11-04 14:55:35	jdv79	i would prefer 20 mins as i'm "slow"; it seems.
2014-11-04 14:57:02	Windy	what are you referring to?
2014-11-04 14:57:06	roycroft	per judging what?
2014-11-04 14:57:17	mashman	12 minutes is fine for me
2014-11-04 14:57:24	roycroft	a single beer?
2014-11-04 14:57:29	mashman	yes
2014-11-04 14:57:45	Windy	in some competition or something? why would there be a time limit?
2014-11-04 14:57:53	roycroft	if you spend 20 minutes per beer and  you have a flight of 8 beers that's 2 hours and 40 minutes for the flight
2014-11-04 14:57:53	mashman	gotta keep things moving
2014-11-04 14:58:09	roycroft	if you're judging two or three flights you have a really long day at that rate

2014-11-04 16:49:53	chris_99	why dangerous?
2014-11-04 16:49:58	mutedog	since usually it was just my wife and I drinking it so we’d consume one bottle in an evening and be pretty wasted
2014-11-04 16:50:28	mutedog	since it was something like 16% at least
2014-11-04 16:50:55	chris_99	if it was all fermented out though?
2014-11-04 16:51:36	mutedog	huh?

2014-11-04 16:52:30	mutedog	oh no, I bottled it still and also pasteurized it
2014-11-04 16:52:45	Leftmost	I am of the school of thought that saké should be served at warm temperature.

2014-11-04 16:54:02	Leftmost	Warmed (but not actually hot) would be acceptable, but I wouldn't want to serve it chilled.
2014-11-04 16:54:58	mutedog	the only time I’ve had it hot it was scalding

2014-11-04 17:11:07	mutedog	also what do you have to crash a giant plow into in order to total it?
2014-11-04 17:11:22	phrak	so, one of the older gentlemen I work with ran the broom part of that plow into a concrete pylon and ripped it off..

2014-11-04 17:12:15	phrak	I think it was the backing it up and hitting it again that set the boss off

2014-11-04 17:13:56	phrak	20 with the police
2014-11-04 17:14:10	phrak	15 with the airport electric shop
2014-11-04 17:14:21	phrak	and been on airfield for a few years now...
2014-11-04 17:15:41	mutedog	dang, how old is he?
2014-11-04 17:15:53	phrak	dunno, but he was in veitnam
2014-11-04 17:16:06	phrak	late 60's I guess?
2014-11-04 17:16:41	mutedog	if he joined the army at 18, 18 + 25 + 20 +15 = 78
2014-11-04 17:16:48	phrak	a good chunk of the army time was reserves or guard if I remember correctly
2014-11-04 17:16:58	mutedog	oh
2014-11-04 17:17:07	phrak	so you can mix police time and army time together
2014-11-04 17:17:31	phrak	I think he's 67
2014-11-04 17:17:40	phrak	but I can't prove that
2014-11-04 17:18:14	phrak	he makes far more from his various retirement checks than he does working for us, that's for certain

2014-11-04 17:49:43	roycroft	my party doesn't have a primary, mosen
2014-11-04 17:49:52	roycroft	it has a party convention to choose candidates
2014-11-04 17:49:58	mosen	ah right
2014-11-04 17:50:39	notluke	Move to amend!
2014-11-04 17:50:41	mosen	I'm not really clued in on your system. Especially the college system because we don't have that kind of thing
2014-11-04 17:50:42	notluke	Corporations are not people.
2014-11-04 17:50:45	mutedog	fotg?
2014-11-04 17:50:46	roycroft	aah, he's your bill sizemore
2014-11-04 17:50:51	roycroft	first out of the gate
2014-11-04 17:50:54	roycroft	i.e. the plurality winner
2014-11-04 17:51:05	mutedog	oh
2014-11-04 17:51:12	jsled	aka. "first past the post"
2014-11-04 17:51:33	mutedog	in wa it’s open primary and the top two vote getters go on to the actual election
2014-11-04 17:51:42	roycroft	yes, that's the more common term that i was spacing out on, jsled
2014-11-04 17:51:42	jsled	the electoral college is basically a non-issue, though it is weird.
2014-11-04 17:51:47	roycroft	notluke: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Sizemore
2014-11-04 17:51:49	roycroft	that's our guy
2014-11-04 17:51:57	roycroft	the electoral college is a good thing imo
2014-11-04 17:52:05	mutedog	so then you are forced to choose between a giant douche and a shit sandwich
2014-11-04 17:52:08	roycroft	but it is not the problem, agreed
2014-11-04 17:52:22	roycroft	preference voting is the key on a local level
2014-11-04 17:52:39	roycroft	we need to break up the duopoly of the republicans and democrats
2014-11-04 17:52:48	roycroft	and preference voting is the only way that will happen in this country

2014-11-04 17:53:14	mutedog	what’s preference voting?
2014-11-04 17:53:21	mashman	I was really hoping the republican party would split with the whole tea party thing
2014-11-04 17:53:22	notluke	Sounds like a starve the beast guy.
2014-11-04 17:53:38	notluke	Collect no taxes, let all government institutions collapse.

2014-11-04 17:54:42	mutedog	that’s probably going to happen eventually, notluke
2014-11-04 17:54:46	roycroft	you rank all the candidates in the order you prefer them
2014-11-04 17:55:07	roycroft	people are afraid to vote for third party candidates because they correctly believe their vote is a wasted vote
2014-11-04 17:55:11	roycroft	with preference voting it is not wasted
2014-11-04 17:55:15	mutedog	ahh
2014-11-04 17:55:21	mutedog	that would be nice
2014-11-04 17:55:46	mutedog	I vote third party because I correctly know that my vote is a wasted vote regardless
2014-11-04 17:55:57	roycroft	say you prefer the libertarian candidate but vote for the republican because if the libertarian does not win the republican best represents your interest, and you think the democrat might beat the republican
2014-11-04 17:56:20	roycroft	with preference voting you rank the libertarian 1, the republican 2, and the democrat 3
2014-11-04 17:56:40	roycroft	if nobody gets 50% when the votes are counted the candidate with the least votes is rejected
2014-11-04 17:56:44	roycroft	and ballots are recounted
2014-11-04 17:56:48	roycroft	say the libertarian came in third
2014-11-04 17:56:53	roycroft	your ballot gets recounted
2014-11-04 17:57:03	roycroft	tossing out the libertarian, ranking the republican 1 and the democrat 2
2014-11-04 17:57:53	roycroft	parts of california use preference voting systems
2014-11-04 17:58:56	roycroft	australia nationally has a system quite similar to what i just described (which is only one form of preference voting - it's known as an instant runoff system)
2014-11-04 18:00:12	mutedog	that would be nice, it’ll never get enacted here
2014-11-04 18:00:50	roycroft	and polls just closed in six states
2014-11-04 18:00:54	roycroft	returns will be comign in soon
2014-11-04 18:03:34	mutedog	time to go not care about politics some more, have a good night everyone, may the masters you have selected oppress you minimally.

2014-11-04 19:11:11	roycroft	wy1469 is my standard yeast for english ales
2014-11-04 19:11:20	roycroft	i absolutely love it
2014-11-04 19:11:23	tomcocca	looking at using it for a oatmeal stout
2014-11-04 19:11:39	tomcocca	where i really want to malt to shine through with little fruitiness
2014-11-04 19:11:47	roycroft	odd for a stout
2014-11-04 19:11:59	thrice	I like the yeast, bu tas said, get lots of the fruit esters out of it
2014-11-04 19:12:09	tomcocca	ok, i've never used it
2014-11-04 19:12:11	roycroft	yes, it's pretty fruity
2014-11-04 19:12:17	roycroft	it makes excellent bitters
2014-11-04 19:12:32	tomcocca	hmm, ok
2014-11-04 19:12:33	roycroft	it flocs really well
2014-11-04 19:12:40	roycroft	which i like
2014-11-04 19:12:47	tomcocca	recommendations for an OS?
2014-11-04 19:12:48	roycroft	it's a fairly low attenuator
2014-11-04 19:13:05	thrice	not trying to defer you, but I think the wyeast description is a little deceiving.  i've feremnted both warm and cold, and still got the esters
2014-11-04 19:13:07	roycroft	i generally use nottingham for my stouts
2014-11-04 19:13:29	roycroft	but i'm not looking for a lot of yeast effect in a stout
2014-11-04 19:13:48	roycroft	ack
2014-11-04 19:13:48	tomcocca	1318 might work better then
