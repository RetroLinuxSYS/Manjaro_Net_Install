2014-10-26 16:46:09	michaelrose	its actually easy
2014-10-26 16:46:19	michaelrose	you want to pass the command to be run to the konsole app
2014-10-26 16:47:16	michaelrose	in the case of konsole the kde terminal its simply something like konsole -e weechat-curses
2014-10-26 16:47:40	michaelrose	you may want to make a shortcut function in your shell of choice that does this
2014-10-26 16:48:03	michaelrose	I use fish I would simply do...
2014-10-26 16:48:10	michaelrose	function wchat
2014-10-26 16:48:25	michaelrose	   konsole -e weechat-curses
2014-10-26 16:48:27	michaelrose	end
2014-10-26 16:48:41	michaelrose	could do the same in bash naturally
2014-10-26 16:48:55	michaelrose	then open up dmenu and type wchat

2014-10-26 16:51:29	michaelrose	functions are a way to map functionality to a command without having 1000 tiny 1-5 little scripts
