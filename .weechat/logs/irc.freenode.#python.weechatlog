2014-11-02 02:32:19	Rhomber	there was already botocore installed.. but it didn't seem to mind.. as root it all works fine
2014-11-02 02:32:29	Rhomber	roots path is: ['/tmp', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/aws_cfn_bootstrap-1.3-py2.7.egg', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pystache-0.5.3-py2.7.egg', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests-1.2.3-py2.7.egg', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/python_daemon-1.6-py2.7.egg', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/lockfile-0.9.1-py2.7.egg', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/boto-2.34.0-py2.7.egg', '/us

2014-11-02 02:33:13	Rhomber	yeah I thought it looked quite ugly
2014-11-02 02:33:26	Rhomber	any way to bootstrap a regular user to include what ever makes root special in this instance?
2014-11-02 02:33:34	ssbr_at_work	I don't know how to correct that. The most I can offer is maybe to just install locally on root and the user and forget about a global install

I have a python script, and in it, I’m using subprocess.call to launch a shell command (rpm -qa postgresql*-server), and assign its value to a variable. I’ve inherited this script and do not understand python very well. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be “chopping up” the variable correctly. Here is what I have so far: http://paste.debian.net/129922/
