2014-10-26 14:43:16	+ringo32	3.14
2014-10-26 14:43:25	+ringo32	i think .?
2014-10-26 14:43:32	+ringo32	mayby 3.12
2014-10-26 14:43:33	+ringo32	:)
2014-10-26 14:43:39	+ringo32	but its always lts
2014-10-26 14:44:06	tyrog	ringo32: Why is pre3 the latest release from mid-August for 0.8.11? Did the development halt for some reason?
2014-10-26 14:44:09	Jeannie	The 0.8.11 rc3 xfce I installed yesterday came with 3.14

2014-10-26 14:46:50	tyrog	that is pre3
2014-10-26 14:46:51	tyrog	not rc3
2014-10-26 14:46:52	+ringo32	tyrog,  came some in between Xorg updates vacation and stuff
2014-10-26 14:46:56	tyrog	it's different
2014-10-26 14:47:13	tyrog	RC3 should be much closer to a final release I believe
2014-10-26 14:47:14	tyrog	than pre3
2014-10-26 14:47:15	+ringo32	now even an idea to change mdm to lightdm possibility
2014-10-26 14:47:58	Jeannie	Install, update and it's , well up to date, releases are only snapshots of  the rolling os
2014-10-26 14:48:49	tyrog	Jeannie: I know but releases are more polished usually. And with newer kernels
2014-10-26 14:48:53	tyrog	and all that stuff
2014-10-26 14:49:05	tyrog	for a rolling release, it's important to keep with the latest stuff
2014-10-26 14:49:36	tyrog	and this is a rolling based on Arch, so very bleeding edge xD
2014-10-26 14:50:00	Jeannie	Update and you'll have the lastest 3.14 kernel
2014-10-26 14:50:15	Jeannie	One command and you'll have kernel 3.16 or even 3.17

2014-10-27 08:32:26	Jeannie	Gnome 3 w/kernel3.17 did not work with  non-free Nvidia drivers though
2014-10-27 08:32:32	simgin	still trying to find your next DE ? :)
2014-10-27 08:32:38	simgin	same
2014-10-27 08:32:42	simgin	here*
2014-10-27 08:33:00	Jeannie	I'll stay with MATE GTK2 as long as possible
2014-10-27 08:33:08	simgin	kk
2014-10-27 08:33:25	Jeannie	Even if that means to build MATE 1.10 from source

2014-10-27 08:33:58	simgin	it seems like there are some distros that are "kind of " maintaining there own MATE's etc atm due to the progression of gtk atm
2014-10-27 08:34:20	simgin	BSD's are I know
2014-10-27 08:34:26	Jeannie	MATE said, V1.10 can be built vs GTK2 or GTK3
2014-10-27 08:34:33	simgin	nice
2014-10-27 08:34:42	Jeannie	The Arch maintaines have decided to onl offer MATE 1.10 GTK3
2014-10-27 08:35:12	simgin	tested GTK3 I guess , cause they must know the issues
2014-10-27 08:35:23	Jeannie	So I will be 'forced' to build from source
2014-10-27 08:35:34	simgin	it's not to hard
2014-10-27 08:35:39	Jeannie	or hope that MATE 1.10 GTK2 is available in aur or in a separate  repo
2014-10-27 08:35:54	simgin	I have a hunch it will be
2014-10-27 08:36:01	Jeannie	I built MATE 1.2 under Debian from source long time ago

2014-10-27 09:33:25	vegaonee	Anyway, any thoughts on awesome vs i3? The system bar in i3 by default is pretty nice, not that nice in awesome (not much info there, and too many workspaces). Yes, I know, everything can be tweaked, etc, etc. But decent defaults is nice. awesome for now at least.
2014-10-27 09:34:12	Drevkevac	vegaonee, I am a lover of KDE, but I have tried both awesome and i3. I think i3 has more polish and a larget community, but both are nice!
2014-10-27 09:34:19	vegaonee	Maybe I just go for awesome because I have been playing around with its config file before, and know what I want to change. And i3 didn't feel that different, so why bother...?
2014-10-27 09:34:51	Drevkevac	that was my experience, I dont think either really had any huge differences or benifits as compared to the other
2014-10-27 09:34:52	vegaonee	Drevkevac: I love KDE as well, but still playing around in the GNU/Linux world.
2014-10-27 09:34:59	simgin	Awesome is the "closest " one to *Box WM's
2014-10-27 09:35:29	simgin	i3 , is one that I will try very soon actually
2014-10-27 09:35:41	vegaonee	awesome has decent defaults for mouse use. Maybe you have that in i3 as well, not sure. Anyway, that shouldn't be of too much importance. Haha
2014-10-27 09:36:05	simgin	it's far more configurable, and it's originally based on Sucklees wmii
2014-10-27 09:36:10	simgin	good sign ;)
2014-10-27 09:36:14	Drevkevac	I did like awesome's defaults better
2014-10-27 09:36:22	vegaonee	simgin, i3?
2014-10-27 09:36:30	Drevkevac	also, if you are trying tiling wms, dont forget to give ratpoison a shot!

2014-10-27 09:37:11	simgin	xmonad , on haskell etc
2014-10-27 09:37:26	simgin	wait
2014-10-27 09:37:53	vegaonee	maybe I should get to know lua better, so I can play around with Prosody XMPP servers too.
2014-10-27 09:38:31	simgin	awesome as a * BOX 'ishit uses mouse when you wnt, i3 you cn use mouse as well( a little bit) but you need to conf. it
2014-10-27 09:38:47	simgin	lua is dangerous ;)

2014-10-27 22:29:51	DiscipleOfDante	Well has a version that works with dark color schemes
2014-10-27 22:30:00	DiscipleOfDante	Preferably something similar to faenzaflattr

2014-10-27 22:37:32	+CountryfiedLinux	It's the most popular theme in GNU Linux it's crazy they don't support KDE.
2014-10-27 22:37:41	DiscipleOfDante	I found Flamini
2014-10-27 22:37:53	DiscipleOfDante	Hey I made a QtCurve theme. Anyone want to play with it?
2014-10-27 22:38:54	RetroLinuxSYS	LOL funny wasn't long ago and everyone went eww kde no now everyone is using kde and i went from kde to i3 
2014-10-27 22:39:34	DiscipleOfDante	I shall be uploading it to kde-look.org as soon as I get some screenshots
2014-10-27 22:39:39	+CountryfiedLinux	RetroLinuxSYS I've always liked KDE. On my laptops currently are Gnome 3.14 and Whatever the DE is called in ChromeOS.

2014-10-27 22:40:12	+CountryfiedLinux	DiscipleOfDante What is QtCurve exactly?
2014-10-27 22:41:05	DiscipleOfDante	lasers, Nah FlaminiWhite worked
2014-10-27 22:41:08	+CountryfiedLinux	KDE has a lot of parts I'm not an expert on all of it :P
2014-10-27 22:41:14	DiscipleOfDante	CountryfiedLinux, A highly configurable style for KWin
2014-10-27 22:41:28	DiscipleOfDante	I guess it could be like a Theme Engine in GTK speak, almost
2014-10-27 22:41:46	DiscipleOfDante	Only easily customized with a very feature rich and easy to use GUI configurator
2014-10-27 22:42:04	DiscipleOfDante	So, QtCurve, Bespin, Oxygen, and Breeze are all the same type of thing
2014-10-27 22:42:22	+CountryfiedLinux	So Plasma is like a Gnome Shell theme and QtCurve what Gtk would be?
2014-10-27 22:42:42	+CountryfiedLinux	I know window decorations is like metacity themes.

2014-10-27 22:47:15	+CountryfiedLinux	I plan to do a net install with KDE on unstable branch to see how Plasma 5 is now.

2014-10-27 22:56:28	+CountryfiedLinux	DiscipleOfDante So what does Plasma 5 have if not QtCurve?
2014-10-27 22:57:19	DiscipleOfDante	Breeze
2014-10-27 22:57:25	DiscipleOfDante	KDE is not Gnome,
2014-10-27 22:57:36	+CountryfiedLinux	No not quite :P
2014-10-27 22:57:49	DiscipleOfDante	Breeze and Oxygen are not themes but styles
2014-10-27 22:57:52	+CountryfiedLinux	Gnome is now my favorite DE. That is with 2 extensions and Plank.
2014-10-27 22:58:03	DiscipleOfDante	The configurations of these styles are themes.
2014-10-27 22:58:08	DiscipleOfDante	QtCurve is the same
2014-10-27 22:58:18	+CountryfiedLinux	Oh, so it's like that middle "filler" part of the theme. Highlights and stuff.
2014-10-27 22:58:35	DiscipleOfDante	Breeze and Oxygen are not very configurable, so the theme is pretty iconic
2014-10-27 22:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	However QtCurve is incredibly configurable
2014-10-27 22:58:53	DiscipleOfDante	CountryfiedLinux, That sounds like color schemes
2014-10-27 22:59:19	DiscipleOfDante	Perhaps the best way you could understand is to install KDE, install QtCurve and Bespin, and play around with configuring them
2014-10-27 23:00:03	+CountryfiedLinux	So is QtCurve to KDE what Widget is to LXDE?
2014-10-27 23:00:15	DiscipleOfDante	No no no
2014-10-27 23:00:32	charlesay	looking at the log i can't see any error messages
2014-10-27 23:00:35	DiscipleOfDante	I don't know anything about LXDE
2014-10-27 23:00:52	DiscipleOfDante	CountryfiedLinux, Just install KDE on something, perhaps a VM, and install QtCurve
2014-10-27 23:00:58	DiscipleOfDante	And play with it
2014-10-27 23:01:02	DiscipleOfDante	And install a few themes
2014-10-27 23:01:05	DiscipleOfDante	You'll get it
2014-10-27 23:02:02	+CountryfiedLinux	Or maybe like control scheme in Mate
2014-10-27 23:02:15	DiscipleOfDante	CountryfiedLinux, No
2014-10-27 23:02:33	DiscipleOfDante	No GTK environment has anything truly comparable to QtCurve
2014-10-27 23:02:41	DiscipleOfDante	Imagine a GUI to make the creation of themes easy
2014-10-27 23:02:50	DiscipleOfDante	For the window manager
2014-10-27 23:04:12	DiscipleOfDante	That is the best way I can describe it
2014-10-27 23:04:41	+CountryfiedLinux	Wait, LXDE isn't Gtk.
2014-10-27 23:05:30	DiscipleOfDante	Yes it is
2014-10-27 23:05:50	DiscipleOfDante	LXQt is not, and using, say, KWin it cna use Qt
2014-10-27 23:05:57	DiscipleOfDante	But LXDE is GTK
2014-10-27 23:06:15	DiscipleOfDante	I think Openbox may have a theme configuration program though
2014-10-27 23:11:22	shndns	LXDE is gtk?
2014-10-27 23:11:41	charlesay	gtk 2 specifically
2014-10-27 23:13:13	shndns	weird i guess i associated it with lxqt i never used it though
2014-10-27 23:13:49	shndns	or even looked into it obviously...
2014-10-27 23:14:01	charlesay	lxqt is a port of lxde from gtk 2 to qt incorporating razor qt

2014-10-28 17:24:35	RetroLinuxSYS	CountryfiedLinux: I dont watch WWE although depending on my mood I might watch MMA
2014-10-28 17:24:57	+CountryfiedLinux	I much prefer TNA over WWE for wrestling, even ROH.
2014-10-28 17:25:13	+CountryfiedLinux	I like MMA. UFC and Bellator are the main companies broadcasted here.
2014-10-28 17:25:30	+CountryfiedLinux	Bellator on Spike and UFC on Fox Sports, and both on PPV.

2014-10-28 17:27:23	+CountryfiedLinux	Of course MMA and pro wrestling are entirely different. One's a sport, the other is just entertainment. Both are very physical. MMA a lot more scary of course :P

2014-10-28 18:14:04	Guest75963	Hi, I just installed Manjaro and I can't seem to get my wireless working. I assume it is a driver issue and I downloaded the "broadcom-wl" package from the AUR, however, I still can not seem to get my wireless working. Could anyone assist me?
2014-10-28 18:15:49	Joshua^Dunamis	Guest75963: your computer? hardware?
2014-10-28 18:16:19	Zenther	that is available from manjaro
2014-10-28 18:16:40	Zenther	you may already have it and just need to 'sudo modprobe wl' to load it
2014-10-28 18:17:54	Guest75963	I have a ThinkPad E545, I don't know what the hardware is off the top of my head. when I ran the modprobe command, it gave me the output "modprobe: FATAL: Module wl not found."
2014-10-28 18:18:28	Zenther	if you don't have it installed, install it for your kernel versions like so: sudo pacman -S linux315-extramodules' and select the broadcom-wl... change 315 to match each kernel version number you have
2014-10-28 18:18:57	Zenther	you can get your hardware chipset with lsusb or lspci in a terminal window
2014-10-28 18:19:21	Zenther	08:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4352 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 03)
2014-10-28 18:19:29	Zenther	that is my broadcom wireless
2014-10-28 18:20:04	Zenther	BCM4352 is the chipset it uses and helpful knowing which broadcom driver to load/use
2014-10-28 18:21:35	Zenther	manjaro builds broadcom drivers to use with their kernels, no need to go to aur for them... those would have to be modified to work on manjaro anyway as manjaro uses different naming for kernels
2014-10-28 18:22:23	Guest75963	Oh. Thank you very much! I'm downloading the official drivers now, hopefully they work.
2014-10-28 18:23:06	Zenther	what chipset is your broadcom?
2014-10-28 18:24:17	Guest75963	BCM43228
2014-10-28 18:25:32	Guest75963	Alright, i just finished installing the official driver. What now?
2014-10-28 18:26:15	Zenther	sudo modprobe wl
2014-10-28 18:26:42	Guest75963	I still recieve the same error
2014-10-28 18:27:24	Zenther	did you get the right kernel number?
2014-10-28 18:27:40	Zenther	linux315 was just an example
2014-10-28 18:28:12	Zenther	uname -a will let you know what kernel you are using
2014-10-28 18:29:12	Guest75963	Ah! I thought I was running a different kernel, thank you.

2014-10-29 00:57:01	DiscipleOfDante	Now if only I could make the translucency work on GTK apps

2014-10-29 00:59:33	coolthingy500	Good luck Dante
2014-10-29 00:59:52	DiscipleOfDante	No luck D: It seems to be a problem with QtCurve-Gtk2 is my guess
2014-10-29 01:01:33	coolthingy500	QT and GTK together can be a pain. I had issues getting Tox working with a QT interface.
2014-10-29 01:01:53	DiscipleOfDante	I know but I mean QtCurve is supposed to work on GTK2
2014-10-29 01:02:05	DiscipleOfDante	And if it weren't for the translucency it woulds work just fine
2014-10-29 01:02:20	DiscipleOfDante	But the point of this theme of mine is to be a translucent theme
2014-10-29 01:02:35	DiscipleOfDante	Anyone else here using KDE with QtCurve?
2014-10-29 01:03:12	DiscipleOfDante	I want to see if it might, just might, just be my darn distribution, and if it fails to work on Manjaro, it may be a glitch in G
2014-10-29 01:03:15	DiscipleOfDante	** QtCurve itself
2014-10-29 01:03:24	<--	tiemay (~user@unaffiliated/tiemay) has left #manjaro ("leaving!")
2014-10-29 01:03:25	coolthingy500	Sorry. On Xfce right now with Lynx for browsing.
2014-10-29 01:03:41	coolthingy500	And no. It's not just with Arch that this issue is popping up.
2014-10-29 01:04:24	DiscipleOfDante	coolthingy500: I am not on Arch, I am on Chakra, which is forked entirely
2014-10-29 01:04:41	DiscipleOfDante	So if this opacity issue turns out to just be on Chakra I will be happy
2014-10-29 01:05:46	coolthingy500	Hope it works out.
2014-10-29 01:06:41	DiscipleOfDante	Because then all I need is probably a rebuild of QtCurve withsome minor changes
2014-10-29 01:06:44	DiscipleOfDante	It seems unlikely
2014-10-29 01:07:55	coolthingy500	How is Chakra working our?
2014-10-29 01:07:59	coolthingy500	out?
2014-10-29 01:08:22	DiscipleOfDante	I like it to be honest, it has been my go to KDE distribution for most of the time I've used linux
2014-10-29 01:10:39	coolthingy500	When I was on Fedora. Gnome and Cinnamon were my DE that I worked with.
2014-10-29 01:10:48	DiscipleOfDante	Cinnamon is nice
2014-10-29 01:10:59	DiscipleOfDante	But you have to be afraid of every GTK3 release
2014-10-29 01:11:06	coolthingy500	Pretty much.
2014-10-29 01:11:26	coolthingy500	I did learn some skills in fixing bugs, but not much.
2014-10-29 01:11:33	coolthingy500	in coding.
2014-10-29 01:12:10	DiscipleOfDante	Fun
2014-10-29 01:13:09	coolthingy500	Almost wanted to go to a QT DE or just jump to a WM system just to avoid most of the GTK3 nonsense.
2014-10-29 01:13:23	DiscipleOfDante	Plasma 5 looks incredibly promising
2014-10-29 01:13:59	coolthingy500	Should be coming down to Manjaro I think? Right?
2014-10-29 01:15:25	DiscipleOfDante	Eventually
2014-10-29 01:15:32	coolthingy500	Lol.
2014-10-29 01:15:49	DiscipleOfDante	It is still deemed unstable, so it is unlikely it will be a featured DE in any distribution soon
2014-10-29 01:16:30	RetroLinuxSYS	I'll stick with my rock stable AwesomeWM install :P 
2014-10-29 01:16:47	RetroLinuxSYS	got the themeing and widgets all laid out the way I like

2014-10-29 08:54:47	+chozen	it never felt quite complete
2014-10-29 08:56:05	Linuxkartoffel	the only thing i don't like is the file-roller depency for nemo
2014-10-29 08:56:14	+chozen	the same can be said for XFCE but I've been doing the XFCE + Compiz combination since Ubuntu 10.10 days on and off so I sorta know how to make it suit my needs by now

2014-10-29 08:58:25	Linuxkartoffel	chozen, the sound applet of cinnamon is the shit. I really love it :P

2014-10-29 08:59:17	Linuxkartoffel	exactly
2014-10-29 08:59:22	TeraJL	my biggest issue with manjaro is that it seems that older wine versions (from playonlinux) are not working , i think it's something related to pulseaudio or something... for league of leagues the patch is simple and patching the League of legends need on the default wine version works fine, but i can't use any of the bootles from playonlinux :/ (manjaro KDE) and this makes it harder to play others games
2014-10-29 09:00:11	Phrk-	Can you play csgo native ?

2014-10-29 09:00:26	+chozen	my problem with MATE is that I keep trying to replicate my gnome 2 setup which was pretty specific but there are just two many inconsistencies

2014-10-29 09:20:41	Warez	ok guys, thanks again for the help and info and ill see you later after i will get my system up and running
2014-10-29 09:20:58	+Jolt2bolt	ok
2014-10-29 09:20:58	Warez	Jolt2bolt: Not really
2014-10-29 09:21:26	+CountryfiedLinux	Seems pretty quick to me Jolt2bolt although it may use more memory and CPU, but if you got plenty then it most likely won't be an issue.
2014-10-29 09:21:39	+CountryfiedLinux	performance > lightweight
2014-10-29 09:22:08	+chozen	why can't you have both CountryfiedLinux? :)
2014-10-29 09:22:38	+CountryfiedLinux	chozen, I don't see why not.
2014-10-29 09:22:40	Warez	Jolt2bolt: i didnt tried 3,14 yet but is not a speed daemon belive me. My opinion is that you need a bigger screen for gnome shell, i cant use it on a 15,6 inch laptop display.
2014-10-29 09:23:00	+CountryfiedLinux	Let me difer that here in a bit brb
2014-10-29 09:23:28	Warez	see u later guys

2014-10-29 09:24:11	+chozen	I tend to agree with Warez on Gnome Shell
2014-10-29 09:24:49	+Jolt2bolt	I would like a DE that was more like center in the benefit of WM in lightweith and the appereance and of a DE
2014-10-29 09:24:55	+chozen	I will agree that it has definitely been improving but I just can't come to see it as a desktop like experience
2014-10-29 09:25:22	+chozen	it feels made for either tablets or very big monitor displays
2014-10-29 09:25:37	+Jolt2bolt	that's too bad....
2014-10-29 09:25:38	+chozen	and I really don't think it's that fast either
2014-10-29 09:26:02	+Jolt2bolt	but like i said, i din't like gnome that much in the past and not much today yet...
2014-10-29 09:26:29	+chozen	definitely faster than 3.12 but not fast enough to make me forget XFCE+Compiz
2014-10-29 09:27:05	+Jolt2bolt	compiz is still alive or the project die a logn ago?
2014-10-29 09:28:26	+chozen	development has stopped (apart from that fiasco happening with Ubuntu and Unity)
2014-10-29 09:28:43	+chozen	I still use the 0.8.9 release

2014-10-29 09:32:19	+chozen	well my view is..if it ain't broke, it doesn't need fixing
2014-10-29 09:33:14	+chozen	Ubuntu's version of compiz is still in development and all it seems to do is add more bloat and break compatibilty with emerald and metacity after each update

2014-10-29 09:37:48	+chozen	that's the reason I keep an eye on Cinnamon and MATE as well...
2014-10-29 09:37:53	+Jolt2bolt	gnome 2 I like it but i liked more KDE3 in that time. KDE didn't have that much bloatware now that i remmember...
2014-10-29 09:38:15	+Jolt2bolt	only the basic..
2014-10-29 09:38:19	+chozen	maybe eventually one of the 2 will get it right sooner rather than later

2014-10-29 17:22:07	+CountryfiedLinux	TeraJL, I don't usee PlayOnLinux but unless you're using BSD then I'd have to assume select GNU.
2014-10-29 17:22:32	+CountryfiedLinux	makes sense to me, mught be helpful
2014-10-29 17:22:48	Linuxkartoffel	TeraJL, if in doubt always take the standard
2014-10-29 17:22:59	Linuxkartoffel	which is gnu netcat
2014-10-29 17:25:28	TeraJL	i thoght so Linuxkartoffel  but as the update give me problemas and had to select the second one i prefered to ask "1) phonon-qt5-gstreamer  2) phonon-qt5-vlc" (here i had to select the 2)
2014-10-29 17:26:29	Linuxkartoffel	TeraJL, well, the first one is the gstreamer backend the second uses the vlc backend
2014-10-29 17:26:39	Linuxkartoffel	if you have all gstreamer packages it should normally work :P

2014-10-29 19:05:15	+zatherz	If only Xfce would choose Qt for the next version, not GTK3...
2014-10-29 19:05:44	+zatherz	just like LXQt
2014-10-29 19:06:21	+CountryfiedLinux	I bet Wayland will eventually be chasing Gtk4 and then Xfce is gonna play catch up again. Wasting valuable resources they could be using for other things.
2014-10-29 19:06:51	+zatherz	Xfce would be lotta better with Qt than GTK 3
2014-10-29 19:07:18	+CountryfiedLinux	I think so. Gtk development seems to outpace Xfce manpower. So far anyway.
2014-10-29 19:07:18	+zatherz	or AT LEAST keep GTK 2, but GTK 3 is starting to be a GNOME-only toolkit
2014-10-29 19:08:32	+zatherz	also, porting Xfce to Qt would make it easy to get Xfce apps (for e.g. Thunar) on other OSes
2014-10-29 19:09:27	+zatherz	if Xfce will still use GTK, LXQt might soon kill it
2014-10-29 19:09:44	+CountryfiedLinux	Isn't Gtk2 supposedly more "bloated" than Gtk3?
2014-10-29 19:09:55	+zatherz	maybe, but GTK 3 themes break with every release
2014-10-29 19:10:00	+CountryfiedLinux	true
2014-10-29 19:10:14	+zatherz	but yeah, GTK 2 is bloated
2014-10-29 19:10:14	+CountryfiedLinux	Good thing the people on gnome-look update them pretty quickly :)
2014-10-29 19:10:21	+CountryfiedLinux	Pretty much overnight even.
2014-10-29 19:10:23	+zatherz	I can even notice when moving windows
2014-10-29 19:10:54	+zatherz	when hovering a Qt window in front of a GTK window, I see visible traces of the window movement for a while
2014-10-29 19:11:16	+zatherz	but if I hover a GTK window in front of a Qt window or a Qt window in front of another Qt window, it's smooth
2014-10-29 19:11:34	+CountryfiedLinux	Here's a video I uploaded showing how I made Gnome most functional (for me anyway) gotta fullscreen to see it well. https://www.dropbox.com/s/x77yh76662b9cie/untitled.mp4?dl=0

2014-10-29 19:23:51	+CountryfiedLinux	Gnome stopped including tweak tool by default a while back. Oh I hope that's not a sign of things to come...
2014-10-29 19:24:37	+CountryfiedLinux	As long as I can tweak it with extensions and a dock it's the best. If not then I may look elsewhere such as KDE, Xfce, Mate, or Cinnamon.

2014-10-30 18:01:29	cx405	oh, good to know. Systemd is just ... different. Every thing has it use. For just starting few daemons and nothing else, it wins hands down. Like running to local shop. But for large, reliable, fast travels, including everything attached. Like starting more daemons efficiently, controling them securely, giving standard system services in DRY way and so on - systemd is better. Well, when it stabilizes.

But recently I changed to an AMD video card (wich I am totally regretting) and I cannot seem to get my monitors aligned correctly. I have been trying to edit my xorg.conf, because the catalyst gui isnt working but so far no success. Can anyone help me or point me in the right dir

2014-10-31 00:54:59	+CountryfiedLinux	Why would they remove functionality?
2014-10-31 00:55:03	manjaromojo	i have bluez4 installed, but I can't find blueman 1.2.3
2014-10-31 00:55:51	manjaromojo	country i dont know. but your question goes to the heart of why linux still sucks.. sorry if that offends anyone but they break more stuff than they fix.. even arch does
2014-10-31 00:56:27	+ringo32	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluez4#Microsoft_Bluetooth_Mobile_Keyboard_6000   something like this  i gues .
2014-10-31 00:56:30	manjaromojo	they should NEVER release stuff till it works and it's well knows bluez5 is half baked
2014-10-31 00:57:32	+ringo32	on a point is sometimes propaganda if they tell linux has lesss brakes but full-rolling on a par can be issuing :/
2014-10-31 00:58:35	manjaromojo	thanks ringo but that's just going backwards.. blueman was a nice graphical interface that worked. now it doesnt.  besides, i've actually tried doing the command promt connection and ran in to problems of packages missing..
2014-10-31 01:00:41	manjaromojo	hahah.. yes Ringo.. Manjaro is the best linux disro I've seen yet and it works better than WIndoz 8 outof the box.. win8 the wifi is screwed up and the bluetooth doesnt work right..  the screen sizes don't fit on monitors properly, hdmi doesnt work properly,, nothing works.. at least manjaro has all that working.. except the bluetooth

2014-10-31 01:01:52	manjaromojo	i have to find out whose in charge of putting stuff in the repositories and ask them to put blueman 1.2.3 back
2014-10-31 01:02:01	+ringo32	that means all semi-new hardware thats in stock can have issues
2014-10-31 01:02:53	manjaromojo	Yeah Ringo.. the problem is they shipped the Win8 OS before giving the proper development tools to the hardware manufactures so they can make proper drivers..   and you have to pay for that imcompetence..

2014-10-31 01:08:13	manjaromojo	blueman 1.2.3 wants bluez4  which is great

2014-10-31 01:18:25	+ringo32	i dont know is auto installed but you can look in therminal but i should look by  pacman -Qs octopi  or pamac

2014-10-31 01:37:46	+CountryfiedLinux	ringo32, So it's pure KDE for those that want it, and more options for those that want more.
2014-10-31 01:38:09	Horace	openbox is not really userfriendly for me but anyway. How do you install 'Mate'?
2014-10-31 01:38:19	+CountryfiedLinux	sudo pacman -S mate

2014-10-31 01:39:49	Horace	Okay
2014-10-31 01:40:05	+ringo32	gnome is an monster on somepoint and less flexible
2014-10-31 01:40:19	Horace	To be quite honest, about 90% of the time, I am on Windows
2014-10-31 01:40:20	+ringo32	kde is an monster but more flexible
2014-10-31 01:40:35	+ringo32	im more pure linux :)
2014-10-31 01:40:43	Horace	The rest of the time, I use Linux to do some development work.
2014-10-31 01:41:15	+CountryfiedLinux	KDE is nice but IMO it's "too much".
2014-10-31 01:41:21	Horace	I have openSUSE 13.2 with Plasma5 and one things I am having issue is the speed at which I switch windows... There are also some minor bugs like screen flickering

2014-10-31 01:51:28	Horace	Yeah
2014-10-31 01:51:38	+ringo32	if you wanna add openbox you can start it with openbox not with kwin
2014-10-31 01:51:45	+ringo32	but you need to install openbox :)
2014-10-31 01:51:55	+ringo32	openbox is just an pure WM not an DE
2014-10-31 01:52:05	Horace	Okay
2014-10-31 01:52:16	+ringo32	manjaro openbox is just openbox with some add-on to make it work :)

2014-10-31 06:22:16	+zatherz	while with yaourt you have to either disable it alltogether or look at the process from time to time to read/not read the PKGBUILDs
2014-10-31 06:22:25	mirazi_heket	another question: is it possible to change IDE mode (to ahci) outside bios?
2014-10-31 06:22:46	mirazi_heket	zatherz: so pacaur is like for advanced users
2014-10-31 06:22:54	+zatherz	totally not
2014-10-31 06:23:01	cx405	So, ladies and gentlemen. In case you missed it. If you are running systemd, make sure that volatile, big, slow stuff uses /var/tmp as temporary directory, not /tmp. /tmp is only seen as fast, small ramdisk by systemd.
2014-10-31 06:23:03	mirazi_heket	hmm
2014-10-31 06:23:31	+zatherz	you just do `pacaur -S PACKAGE-NAME'
2014-10-31 06:23:45	+zatherz	it reads your pacman configs
2014-10-31 06:23:53	Linuxkartoffel	cx405, meh, i have /var/ on a ssd :P
2014-10-31 06:23:53	+zatherz	and searches for things like "Color"
2014-10-31 06:23:57	cx405	why, for "advanced"? yaourt also asks to show PKGBUILDs. Just not in advance.
2014-10-31 06:24:28	mirazi_heket	i get lost in english :) doing too many things at once
2014-10-31 06:24:46	cx405	Linuxkartoffel: Thats the answer of "heftig", archdev. This is why, for example, flash is no longer using /tmp as it should.
2014-10-31 06:25:28	cx405	They basically already did the split, I though they should do. /tmp is for small, predictable, fast stuff. /var/tmp is for huge, unpredictable, slow stuff.
2014-10-31 06:25:57	Linuxkartoffel	cx405, from what you are telling me i can't see if it is now positive or negative for you
2014-10-31 06:25:59	Linuxkartoffel	so..?
2014-10-31 06:26:12	mirazi_heket	should i pick (sata mode) ide or ahci?
2014-10-31 06:26:31	cx405	yeah. I will still be looking how to make flash use /var/tmp instead. At least, I know now that tmp has been split.
2014-10-31 06:26:50	cx405	mirazi_heket: why do you want legacy ide mode?

2014-10-31 09:40:03	+zatherz	as the KDE SC has tons of games, a web browser, mail client, IRC client and a shitton of other things
2014-10-31 09:40:03	cx405	why? There are no "suite" like KDE.
2014-10-31 09:40:54	cx405	KDE web browser should be killed with fire. Both of them. One is too buggy. Other is straight outdated. But those are not really a problem.
2014-10-31 09:41:02	+zatherz	rekonq is not a KDE browser
2014-10-31 09:41:15	+zatherz	and konqueror is a nice Qt browser actually
2014-10-31 09:41:30	+zatherz	there are not many good Qt browsers, excluding Opera
2014-10-31 09:41:32	cx405	konqueror is html4. and rendering incorrectly.

2014-10-31 11:20:16	cx405	Washing with soap can help. Use warm water and wipe with very gentle cloths to not scratch. Afterwards, dd_rescue to build an image.
2014-10-31 11:20:35	cx405	you can also try to dbus-launch dolphin in terminal then watch for exact error messages.

2014-10-31 15:45:00	hugonz	I'm having a problem where all the swap gets allocated and I cannot start new processes. $top shows all swap used (1 GB swap in a SSD) even when actual RAM is not used. Actually there's no reaosn for this, as only a few applications are open. I know this could be a process leaking memory, but so single process shows with a lot of RAM allocated.
2014-10-31 15:45:06	+zatherz	Horace: even KDE 4.13 in this benchmark runs with 302.6 MiB, where are you getting the numbers from? Hundred years into the future?

2014-10-31 15:46:16	Horace	Regardless, I did say that Windows is more bloated than Linux, it can't compete
2014-10-31 15:46:37	+zatherz	Horace: you said your Windows installation which uses freaking 1.4 GB of RAM when idle is comparable to XFCE
2014-10-31 15:46:43	Horace	But to be quite honest with you, with about 40-70 tabs open in Light FIrefox and 10-30 tabs open in Chrome
2014-10-31 15:46:53	Horace	My Windows never touchs swap

2014-10-31 15:49:19	Horace	Ram is not issue for me, I have 8GB of ram, as long I never touch SWAP doing normal tasks that I do. And Windows 7 using all my free RAM for cache... Oh God, makes me so happy, switch between applications tabs, starting APPS can't be more faster
2014-10-31 15:49:52	Horace	Honestly, I think that subjective, my Windows 7 is as fast as XFCE and faster than Gnome3/KDE

2014-10-31 15:53:14	Horace	Yes it is

2014-10-31 15:53:41	+CountryfiedLinux	Actually I find Linux to be more user friendly than Windows, even Mac.

2014-10-31 15:55:04	+CountryfiedLinux	But there are some UI turds (IMO) in Linux.
2014-10-31 15:55:05	Horace	I have done it the past so many times
2014-10-31 15:55:21	Horace	When my HDD died, I installed Linux on a USB flash drive
2014-10-31 15:55:25	+CountryfiedLinux	For example I'm not fond of Enlightenment, Openbox, and LXDE.

2014-10-31 15:55:50	Horace	A bit after KDE4 was release
2014-10-31 15:55:57	Horace	I think it was KDE 4.1/2
2014-10-31 15:55:58	peaveyman	I like Enlightenment but it still needs a lot of work, imo

2014-10-31 16:02:30	peaveyman	TBH, I think the installer for Manjaro is what helps me but I am sure I forgot something the last time I tried to install Arch
2014-10-31 16:03:04	+CountryfiedLinux	zatherz, I just figured that if Manjaro had a Crouton then that would bring in AUR which has Chrome which has flash. Didn't think about Adobe much there.
2014-10-31 16:03:07	peaveyman	But Manjaro is considered a rolling release, is it not, even though they hold packages

2014-10-31 16:11:52	+CountryfiedLinux	Actually the ones I use didn't break.
2014-10-31 16:11:54	+zatherz	and bring things that should be already in GNOME
2014-10-31 16:12:00	+zatherz	CountryfiedLinux: because their devs update them ;)
2014-10-31 16:12:02	+CountryfiedLinux	Hide Top Bar and Gno-Menu did not break on me.

2014-10-31 16:14:43	+CountryfiedLinux	There's other desktop options if Gnome doesn't cut it anymore.
2014-10-31 16:14:53	+CountryfiedLinux	Like KDE, Cinnamon, Xfce, and Mate.
2014-10-31 16:14:58	+zatherz	CountryfiedLinux: intentionally breaking themes every release and calling themes "not needed" is good?

2014-10-31 16:17:04	+CountryfiedLinux	I agree zatherz in some ways Gnome sucks. As long as I can easily make it how I want it I'm happy though. If they kill off community extensions I'm done.

2014-11-01 08:35:19	@ringo32	vbox has also own video driver you see on mhwd -li
2014-11-01 08:35:21	+zatherz	if that would be a driver error
2014-11-01 08:35:25	+zatherz	then xorg would tell you

2014-11-01 08:46:31	+zatherz	well
2014-11-01 08:46:37	+zatherz	that means you have not installed plasma...
2014-11-01 08:46:42	natanvarga	hm
2014-11-01 08:46:46	+zatherz	<obligatory facepalm>
2014-11-01 08:46:50	natanvarga	so how would i go about doing that
2014-11-01 08:46:54	natanvarga	I thought i had done it
2014-11-01 08:47:03	+zatherz	plasma-next group in Manjaro does not contain whole plasma
2014-11-01 08:47:07	+zatherz	I thought you installed it from unstable
2014-11-01 08:47:10	natanvarga	*facepalm*
2014-11-01 08:47:17	+zatherz	*obligatory giant facepalm*
2014-11-01 08:47:25	+zatherz	you have to enable the unstable repo
2014-11-01 08:47:28	natanvarga	let me see
2014-11-01 08:47:52	natanvarga	oaky im switching
2014-11-01 08:47:55	natanvarga	*okay
2014-11-01 08:48:18	natanvarga	im not a kde guy :D
2014-11-01 08:48:29	+zatherz	I thought you already knew...
2014-11-01 08:48:30	+zatherz	lol
2014-11-01 08:48:46	+zatherz	the reason xinit didn't start is because startkde was not even available
2014-11-01 08:48:46	@ringo32	zatherz,  natanvarga  is more an TWM :)
2014-11-01 08:49:01	natanvarga	true that
2014-11-01 08:49:03	+zatherz	ringo32: I'm an awesome guy
2014-11-01 08:49:04	+zatherz	ringo32: ;)
2014-11-01 08:49:23	+zatherz	(if you don't get it - awesome is a WM)
2014-11-01 08:49:34	natanvarga	so what do i install from instable?
2014-11-01 08:49:41	+zatherz	natanvarga: first update repos
2014-11-01 08:49:45	+zatherz	natanvarga: pacman -Syy
2014-11-01 08:50:04	+zatherz	there are two 'y's here
2014-11-01 08:50:05	natanvarga	*unstable
2014-11-01 08:50:22	natanvarga	yeah im doing -Syyu
2014-11-01 08:50:46	+zatherz	you will have many, many packages to update
2014-11-01 08:50:56	natanvarga	i know
2014-11-01 08:51:03	natanvarga	270MB
2014-11-01 08:51:06	+zatherz	oh
2014-11-01 08:51:09	natanvarga	could be worse
2014-11-01 08:51:11	+zatherz	yaeh
2014-11-01 08:51:13	+zatherz	*yeah
2014-11-01 08:51:18	+zatherz	you could have installed the whole kde group
2014-11-01 08:51:22	+zatherz	which is ~2GB
2014-11-01 08:51:28	natanvarga	yeah
2014-11-01 08:51:31	+zatherz	and every update is like 500MB+
2014-11-01 08:51:38	natanvarga	no i only installed kf5 stuff i think
2014-11-01 08:51:42	+zatherz	yeah
2014-11-01 08:52:00	+zatherz	kf5 + plasma next + dolphin + kate + konsole
2014-11-01 08:52:01	+zatherz	is enough
2014-11-01 08:52:07	natanvarga	kate is what?
2014-11-01 08:52:15	+zatherz	KDE advanced text editor

2014-11-01 08:52:56	+zatherz	so it will install Dolphin 4.something, Kate 4.something and Konsole 4.something alongside Plasma 5
2014-11-01 08:53:08	+zatherz	you might also want rekonq
2014-11-01 08:53:18	+zatherz	or other browser
2014-11-01 08:53:23	+zatherz	I think Konqueror will soon die
2014-11-01 08:53:35	natanvarga	yeah once i have a terminal i can get what i want i guess
2014-11-01 08:53:40	+zatherz	because Dolphin already manages files
2014-11-01 08:53:50	+zatherz	and Rekonq is million times better for web browsing
2014-11-01 08:54:03	+zatherz	Konqueror is basically obsolete
2014-11-01 08:54:27	+zatherz	I guess soon the KDE team will start developing Rekonq
2014-11-01 08:54:47	natanvarga	alright so once i've done the updates how do i get the rest of kde5 that im missing?
2014-11-01 08:54:52	+zatherz	because IIRC it is not an official KDE app
2014-11-01 08:55:11	cx405	rekonq today is still unstable and plugin-less.
2014-11-01 08:55:23	cx405	but very light and fast
2014-11-01 08:55:42	Joshua^Dunamis	KDE uses Konversation as IRC client
2014-11-01 08:55:50	+zatherz	I heard it's going to support pepperflash plugins
2014-11-01 08:55:54	+zatherz	*pepper plugins
2014-11-01 08:56:01	+zatherz	natanvarga: I think 'pacman -S plasma-next kdebase-dolphin kdebase-konsole rekonq' is enough
2014-11-01 08:57:17	+zatherz	oh, nice, kwin is getting a little bit less laggy

2014-11-01 08:59:04	+zatherz	cx405: because they're not yet ready to replace KDE4 apps
2014-11-01 08:59:15	+zatherz	cx405: and if someone wants to try them
2014-11-01 08:59:23	cx405	zatherz: why do you want them to go in opt?
2014-11-01 08:59:23	+zatherz	cx405: they will be able to
2014-11-01 08:59:38	+zatherz	cx405: because when installing normally you have to replace the KDE4 apps
2014-11-01 08:59:48	cx405	zatherz: Ahhh never mind
2014-11-01 08:59:56	+zatherz	cx405: and KDE 5 apps are missing tons of things
2014-11-01 09:00:01	+zatherz	cx405: they're basically not useable yet
2014-11-01 09:00:12	+zatherz	*usable
2014-11-01 09:00:38	cx405	zatherz: yeah, I understand. Personally I am fine with kde4, I am fine with dev model where features grow over time as it stabilizes. Everything i super :)
2014-11-01 09:00:42	cx405	is*
2014-11-01 09:00:43	natanvarga	o yeah im getting more stuff now
2014-11-01 09:01:04	+zatherz	natanvarga: yeah, you should get things like systemsettings, plasma-workspace etc.

2014-11-01 11:26:15	osutapu	Hey guys. I have an issue with manjaro. I need to install custom LAN driver (r8169), cuz default one in kernel (r8168) doesn't work with my network card because of windows driver. The thing is - I can't install it, it gives me an error that it can't build the module. I had same error on Lubuntu and all i needed to do was to download .deb packages for linux-headers and build-essential using windows (which has internet access) and m
2014-11-01 11:27:32	osutapu	After it driver installed fine. Question: What i have to download and install in manjaro to get it to work? And how do i install it? I am newbiie to arch-based distos
2014-11-01 11:27:52	--	chmurifree is now known as chmuri
2014-11-01 11:28:07	Linuxkartoffel	osutapu, pacman -S linux'number'-headers installs the headers for your kernel
2014-11-01 11:28:15	Linuxkartoffel	uname -r says you which kernel you have
2014-11-01 11:28:31	Jeannie	kernel headers are available, base-devel is what you need for building
2014-11-01 11:29:41	osutapu	Linuxkartoffel, i have no internet in Manjaro until i install that driver, so i need to manually download in windows/install that package and deps, but how? Again, newbie
2014-11-01 11:31:11	+Jolt2bolt	I don't inderstand, the network work out of the box in manjaro distro so, you don't need install nothing

2014-11-01 11:32:38	osutapu	+Jolt2bolt it's a known bug, nothing helps except installing driver provided by Realtek
2014-11-01 11:33:02	+Jolt2bolt	don't you have another computer to download it?
2014-11-01 11:33:56	Linuxkartoffel	somebody remember the pacman command to just download a package?
2014-11-01 11:34:16	osutapu	i have it downloaded, but i just can't install it in manjaro

2014-11-01 11:35:52	Kwisher	there are realtek packages available in aur
2014-11-01 11:36:08	+Jolt2bolt	but he doesn't have Internet so...
2014-11-01 11:36:23	osutapu	again, had same error while installing it in Lubuntu. downloading .deb packages for linux-headers and build-essential (and dependencies for them) on other machine, and installing them manually helped
2014-11-01 11:36:32	Kwisher	osutapu: is this wifidriver?
2014-11-01 11:36:37	osutapu	no
2014-11-01 11:37:50	osutapu	so, i need packages that play same role as linux-headers and build-essential play in *buntu, links to them, and how to manually install it
2014-11-01 11:38:04	osutapu	C:
2014-11-01 11:38:06	+Jolt2bolt	pacman -U /path/to/package/package_name-version.pkg.tar.xz
2014-11-01 11:38:07	Kwisher	did you try sudo pacman -U [path to package file]
2014-11-01 11:38:20	+Jolt2bolt	that the command but try to download it from aur
2014-11-01 11:38:35	osutapu	well i don't know which packages i have to download

2014-11-01 11:39:19	+Jolt2bolt	ups then you have to find out what package it is...
2014-11-01 11:39:30	osutapu	yes, but which ones are playing role of linux-headers and build-essential in arch-based distros?
2014-11-01 11:40:03	+Jolt2bolt	depende the distro you used before i think...
2014-11-01 11:40:36	+Jolt2bolt	depends*

It seems that switching it to Disable has no effect (you will notice the Link light still turns off upon Windows shutdown). One rather dirty workaround is to boot to Windows and just reset the system (perform a
2014-11-01 14:24:49	osutapu	not giving the Windows driver a chance to disable LAN. The Link light will remain on and the LAN adapter will remain accessible after POST - that is until you boot back to Windows and shut it down properly again.
2014-11-01 14:25:09	osutapu	that dirty workaround did help too

This way it should be fixed system-wide and not only under Arch (eg. live CDs, other operative systems). In Windows, under Device Manager, find your Realtek network adapter and double-click it. Under the "Advanced" tab, change "Wake-on-LAN after shutdown" to "Enable"."

2014-11-01 16:30:05	Emanon	And AIR isn't a "resist the system" thing. It's a part of an ARG trying to prevent a corrupt future system from arising.
2014-11-01 16:30:47	Emanon	Think of it like Bruce Willis' character in 12 Monkeys. Using knowledge of the future to change it.

2014-11-02 01:37:29	RetroLinuxSYS	So hows it been going ringo32 any new and exciting things 
2014-11-02 01:37:54	+ringo32	pretty boring now :p
2014-11-02 01:38:15	+ringo32	had to look for my Cinnamon spin but :/
2014-11-02 01:40:04	RetroLinuxSYS	Same here I got my desktop setup now I made AwesomeWM work better as a hybrid wm  took forever trying to figure out how to get it to recognize floating tags and that when i'm on that tag anything I open needs to have a titlebar and icons (close, minimize, maximize) but when I'm on my other tags for it to work like a tiling window manager with no titlebars etc
2014-11-02 01:41:02	+ringo32	Cool :) had tried awesome in the past but couldn attached on :)
2014-11-02 01:41:08	+ringo32	im lazy :)
2014-11-02 01:42:11	RetroLinuxSYS	I also got dmenu to popup a box when you open an application asking is this a terminal app or a desktop app.  If you select terminal it knows to open it up with your default terminal and if you do desktop it just opens it up normally.  Plus it saves your choice in a file so you never have to select it again
2014-11-02 01:44:08	+ringo32	ill try everytime to commit to I3 , after few days always get lame :)
2014-11-02 01:45:08	RetroLinuxSYS	I loved i3's manual tiling but i3 in and of itself is too static.  The config file is easy but if you want to do anything that the config file doesn't specify it gets extremly hard or impossible
2014-11-02 01:45:47	RetroLinuxSYS	Awesome allows me to do more with Lua but at the same time being FAR easier than Xmonad's Haskell

2014-11-02 01:48:55	RetroLinuxSYS	built mine from the net install of manjaro

2014-11-02 01:49:49	RetroLinuxSYS	gotta figure out how to use the tools though to do it
2014-11-02 01:50:21	+ringo32	you can ask culinax for his profile and some side info :p i have told him a bit the basics
2014-11-02 01:50:37	+ringo32	how to make an own Manjaroiso profile
2014-11-02 01:51:02	RetroLinuxSYS	might do that, right now all i have is a python script i made that installs the packages I need along with copying over all my dot files from my server and all the folders that need to be created
2014-11-02 01:52:00	+ringo32	if you see scripts you can easily some part read out only know wich script basicly

2014-11-02 02:32:35	+ringo32	Debian-Experimental is more bleeding edge

2014-11-02 13:41:34	ParkerR	I'm trying to boot the XFCE live install from a live USB on a Toshiba C55-B5299. Disabled secure boot and switched UEFI to CSM. Manjaro starts up but goes to a black screen. Trying again but setting acpi to off on the boot screen works but then I get a "fatal no screens found" and X doesnt start. Any ideas?

2014-11-02 15:05:52	coolthingy500	ParkerR Nice
2014-11-02 15:06:22	coolthingy500	ParkerR I was a fedora user with mate, So I didn't come to Manjaro as a beginner.
2014-11-02 15:06:30	ParkerR	:)
2014-11-02 15:06:39	ParkerR	I went from debian sid to plain Arch
2014-11-02 15:06:45	ParkerR	Love it so much
2014-11-02 15:06:53	Linuxkartoffel	ParkerR, i went from debian wheezy to manjaro then to arch then back to manjaro :P
2014-11-02 15:07:02	ParkerR	Heh
2014-11-02 15:07:22	ParkerR	Once you go Arch... oh wait Linuxkartoffel disproves that :P
2014-11-02 15:07:37	Linuxkartoffel	no,no Arch is great, i'm just to lazy :D
2014-11-02 15:07:37	coolthingy500	Cool. I don't hate debian. But the reason I was using RPM for the longest time is due to the package managers.
2014-11-02 15:07:55	coolthingy500	Till Pacman took over
2014-11-02 15:07:56	ParkerR	pacman + AUR is the best combo, I swear

2014-11-02 15:19:40	coolthingy500	in Octopi Go to file, and fine install local package. Make sure the format is in Tar.gz
2014-11-02 15:22:25	coolthingy500	I don't think that Arch or Arch-based systems use a package that works like RPM, or Deb. I don't know for sure.

2014-11-02 15:37:05	Linuxkartoffel	coolthingy500, still, if i ever have to use software that isn't in the repo or in the aur i'm gonna write a PKGBUILD for it :P

2014-11-02 15:38:55	coolthingy500	I'll admit. PKGBUILD is cleaner then using Yaourt.

Either they are bad with logic, or they are a backdoor, or both plus they are govt paid backdoor. Plugin is gpl3, but search requests are proxied to them.

2014-11-04 16:55:41	cx405	coagen: I guess discontinue search. If software is gpl3, then only things left are - hidden exploits (similar to debian ssh weakness, ssl weakness etc) or "false sense of safely" by actually allowing some tracking under reasoning of: 1.sorry, had no time for update 2.notbug,feature.  Just speculating here, but search is indeed suspicious. Still, miles better than ghostery.

2014-11-04 17:17:48	cx405	I have a IGP with nvidia bought in 2009, when it did made sence. The IGP is 8300, and its connected to still working CRT. CRT does not report monitor capabilities properly, so with nvidia not supporting the IGP anymore, nouveau goes ahead and sets 2K resolution (2048x something). Only manual edit of xorg.conf fixes it. Mhwd does not support changing of default resolution/limiting resolutions(its xorg.conf feature).

I was talking that for sending text content in terminal windows, and window borders (as simple lines) Xorg protocol is very much supreme to anything Wayland. Wayland is more geared towards how modern GPUs work, supporting them and their features better as middle-ware. Anywhere a word "toolkit" appears, it will probably not be wayland, unless its very line-based protocol

2014-11-04 18:51:58	day|flip	Fedora or Ubuntu?
2014-11-04 18:52:01	+CountryfiedLinux	Although I opted for developer mode on the Chromebook so I can write ISOs to usb sticks.
2014-11-04 18:52:19	+CountryfiedLinux	Neither on the Chromebook just ChromeOS.

2014-11-04 18:53:21	viking60	CountryfiedLinux, have you tried installing other Linux on it?
2014-11-04 18:53:30	day|flip	Your Ok with ChromeOS design
2014-11-04 18:53:33	+CountryfiedLinux	I've Crouton installed Ubuntu.
2014-11-04 18:53:53	+CountryfiedLinux	It's great except for the fact PPA and flash aren't supported.
2014-11-04 18:54:11	+CountryfiedLinux	And couldn't get a video download to play locally on the Ubuntu side. Had to go ChromeOS for that.
2014-11-04 18:54:20	day|flip	lol
2014-11-04 18:54:43	+CountryfiedLinux	So because of those issues it's not really worth it if it isn't "complete" to me. I'll keep GNU Linux on the Gateway laptop and ChromeOS in dev mode on the Chromebook.
2014-11-04 18:55:09	day|flip	i see
2014-11-04 18:55:16	+CountryfiedLinux	Funny that the only thing I even use developer mode on the Chromebook for is writing ISO to usb sticks :P
2014-11-04 18:55:27	+CountryfiedLinux	ChromeOS is Gentoo based BTW but ya wouldn't know it :P
2014-11-04 18:56:00	day|flip	But it not like you can used there repo
2014-11-04 18:56:35	day|flip	just Chrome extensions
2014-11-04 18:58:26	+CountryfiedLinux	true
2014-11-04 18:58:37	+CountryfiedLinux	I'm ok with that, I know it's a Chromebook.
2014-11-04 18:59:15	+CountryfiedLinux	There are actually a lot of apps that run independeltly of the browser even in GNU Linux after installing Chrome browser you'll see your ChromeOS apps in the menu.
2014-11-04 18:59:42	+CountryfiedLinux	Like Byrd IRC for example it runs independently from the browser in it's own app window with Chrome closed even.
2014-11-04 19:00:02	day|flip	how is Chromebook support on music files?
2014-11-04 19:00:13	+CountryfiedLinux	Google Music
2014-11-04 19:00:15	+CountryfiedLinux	in the cloud
2014-11-04 19:00:27	+CountryfiedLinux	I dunno if there's local storage players or not though.

2014-11-09 21:05:25	fig	so arch based distro are better than debian? are yuoiu using a fast system?
2014-11-09 21:05:41	drfoobaz	I prefer arch based distros.
2014-11-09 21:05:59	ManjaroRed	arch <3
2014-11-09 21:06:01	charlesay	i don't know if i'd say that, i also use ubuntu
2014-11-09 21:06:15	fig	are you using xfce?
2014-11-09 21:06:16	ManjaroRed	Manjaro is more and more buggy, I mean it has high bugs
2014-11-09 21:06:21	drfoobaz	Oh not that extreme
2014-11-09 21:06:24	ManjaroRed	so I may change to Arch Linux again
2014-11-09 21:06:25	drfoobaz	I agree about the buggy stuff
2014-11-09 21:06:46	ManjaroRed	Like my sound is stopped as soon there is an alert sound or skype sound, like the server sound doesn't handle well the events
2014-11-09 21:06:48	charlesay	but for my former chromebook i choose manjaro/xfce because it was easier to make it lean
2014-11-09 21:06:50	fig	wow really
2014-11-09 21:07:00	ManjaroRed	Sometimes on boot it only detects one core of my CPU, no way to fix it
2014-11-09 21:07:24	fig	have you heard of antergos,?

2014-11-09 21:08:00	charlesay	and i choose manjaro over straight arch because there are very few breakages with updates and i didn't want go through the hassle
2014-11-09 21:08:12	fig	arch based and nice looking
2014-11-09 21:08:27	ManjaroRed	Seems not everyone has same opinions on Manjaro :P
2014-11-09 21:08:28	charlesay	fig: i have heard of antergos but haven't used it, from what i gather manjaro is preferrale

2014-11-09 21:10:28	ManjaroRed	manjaro get more and more unstable with recent updates unfortunately
2014-11-09 21:10:38	charlesay	ManjaroRed: what have you done to your system? the two i have are quite stable
2014-11-09 21:10:59	ManjaroRed	I've done a sudo pacman -Syu
2014-11-09 21:11:05	ManjaroRed	no problem
2014-11-09 21:11:15	ManjaroRed	but since two weeks manjaro gets very crazy
2014-11-09 21:11:35	ManjaroRed	sometimes the Xorg gets screwed up
2014-11-09 21:11:47	ManjaroRed	it shows a lot of weird colorful lines onto what I should see x)
2014-11-09 21:11:54	ManjaroRed	CPU isn't well detected
2014-11-09 21:12:00	charlesay	what kind of graphics setup do you have?
2014-11-09 21:12:01	ManjaroRed	pulseaudio is weird too
2014-11-09 21:12:05	charlesay	nvidia card?
2014-11-09 21:12:08	ManjaroRed	nVidia 660GTX Ti
2014-11-09 21:12:37	fig	 So most of the people are using xfce I suppose
2014-11-09 21:12:39	charlesay	make sure that you have the right driver installed, nvidia deprecated one line, i think.
2014-11-09 21:13:03	charlesay	there are a few forum threads describing what to do when you have these problems
2014-11-09 21:13:24	drfoobaz	I would use Openbox but wifi never works off the bat with openbox
2014-11-09 21:13:34	charlesay	fig: i guess of the official flavours it is the most popular
2014-11-09 21:13:49	drfoobaz	I used the gnome one for a while
2014-11-09 21:14:22	ManjaroRed	cinnamon and gnome 3 <3
2014-11-09 21:14:28	RetroLinuxSYS	Xorg causes me no issues but I use AwesomeWM
2014-11-09 21:14:29	drfoobaz	Yeah. Anyone use cinnamon?
2014-11-09 21:14:31	ManjaroRed	charlesay it's not a problem of driver as I meant
2014-11-09 21:14:39	ManjaroRed	it's about Manjaro
2014-11-09 21:14:51	ManjaroRed	driver was installed since beginning and I never had problem since beginning
2014-11-09 21:15:24	charlesay	ManjaroRed: well, there are driver updates, so they change. that's the thing with a rolling release

2014-11-09 21:16:44	RetroLinuxSYS	:P one lazy reason i use manjaro is since I have the entire repository on my external drive and since manjaro has all the drivers catalyst/nvidia etc I can use my systems away from home and without issue.  Just as long as they are not AUR packages and since I have the package for the arch-wiki i'm set
2014-11-09 21:17:03	RetroLinuxSYS	just a different window manager that uses lua

2014-11-09 21:21:27	RetroLinuxSYS	seeing how manjaro has broadcom-wl drivers already i would say its a snap since I do know the net install does install wpasupplement as well or whatever that package is called :P

2014-11-09 21:24:46	drfoobaz	Sounds like the manjaro net install is the easiest way
2014-11-09 21:24:51	drfoobaz	From what retro said
2014-11-09 21:25:10	RetroLinuxSYS	i3 doesn't allow floating workspaces and a few other things i want, plus it lacks in mouse support for the days when I want to use it
2014-11-09 21:25:50	drfoobaz	Oh.
2014-11-09 21:26:10	fig_	so let's say install the net install and then about DE?

2014-11-09 21:27:01	day|flip	awesome is good option. tbh it not that hard to get setup if you want to copy theme RetroLinuxSYS

2014-11-09 21:35:03	drfoobaz	Yeah.
2014-11-09 21:35:07	drfoobaz	But why fluxbox over openbox?

2014-11-09 21:36:29	day|flip	there both nice but if you ever had to change thing by hand on config side. openbox is a huge pain the ass over fluxbox. reason. it xml config system. fluxbox used text but it still very simple to understand

2014-11-09 21:37:36	fig_	so how do you start awesome?
2014-11-09 21:37:49	drfoobaz	$ awesome probably
2014-11-09 21:37:51	RetroLinuxSYS	i3 has very very easy config file but its ease of use comes as a problem when you want to do things outside of the normal config.  Awesome and Xmonad allow you to do a ton more since awesome is extended by lua and xmonad by haskell but I chose awesome because xmonad is a NIGHTMARE to config since I dont know any haskel
2014-11-09 21:38:09	RetroLinuxSYS	edit your .xinitrc file to have exec awesome
2014-11-09 21:38:12	RetroLinuxSYS	then i do startx

2014-11-09 21:38:53	drfoobaz	How the fuck is that supposed to work.
2014-11-09 21:39:02	RetroLinuxSYS	drfoobaz: your config file is technically a haskell program you compile
2014-11-09 21:39:13	drfoobaz	God. sounds like emacs and lisp.
2014-11-09 21:39:47	RetroLinuxSYS	well awesome uses lua but its kinda self explains itself but you can look at some haskell config options and be like WTF does that do
2014-11-09 21:39:57	day|flip	drfoobaz: yes. i don't have to deal with trying to figure out 4 to 5 line of xml confige setting vs 2 line of very simple to understand text.

2014-11-10 17:14:15	Horace	I have tons of other things
2014-11-10 17:14:25	+CountryfiedLinux	Horace, Zorin OS has the most "Windows-like" interface that I know of.

2014-11-10 17:14:42	Horace	CountryfiedLinux: It don't want ti to be /windows like/
2014-11-10 17:14:47	+CountryfiedLinux	Horace, Windows 7-like that is.

2014-11-10 17:14:54	Horace	Ahhh
2014-11-10 17:15:02	Horace	Yeah Windows 7 like is good
2014-11-10 17:15:12	Horace	But I want to try a new GUI
2014-11-10 17:15:21	Tarax	ringo32: I don't follow
2014-11-10 17:15:23	Horace	I am going to try openSUSE GNOME
2014-11-10 17:15:25	+CountryfiedLinux	Horace, The most popular desktops are probably Gnome, KDE, and Unity. Xfce is up there too and Mate is gaining ground.
2014-11-10 17:15:32	+ringo32	coc00n,  sometimes on pulse issue can remove map of pulse solved pulse makes a new one
2014-11-10 17:15:43	day|flip	coc00n: you could just trying moving to testing repo
2014-11-10 17:15:46	Horace	mate, I don't like how it categorize applications
2014-11-10 17:15:48	Horace	also
2014-11-10 17:15:55	Horace	There is no search function
2014-11-10 17:16:03	+CountryfiedLinux	Horace, In the Gnome route I recommend you check out http://extensions.gnome.org to make it more "usable". Gnome is my favorite BTW but I do use extensions :)
2014-11-10 17:16:04	Horace	And I want to have favorites
2014-11-10 17:16:10	+ringo32	Tarax,  te welcome screen and option to use free and nonfree using syslinux basicly
2014-11-10 17:16:23	+ringo32	you have lot bootloaders for livecd is it syslinux
2014-11-10 17:16:45	+CountryfiedLinux	Actually IMO all vanilla desktops require tweaking :P
2014-11-10 17:17:20	Horace	yeah

2014-11-10 17:18:10	+CountryfiedLinux	Horace, There's also a number of custom "shells" for Windows and a new package manager called Chocolatey. Just thought I'd point that out.
2014-11-10 17:18:21	Horace	KDE offers some of what I want but it's slow at switching Windows
2014-11-10 17:18:23	+ringo32	coc00n, you rebooted ?
2014-11-10 17:18:25	day|flip	coc00n: what the main reason you like using pulseaudio for over alsa? if you still using alsa anyway
2014-11-10 17:18:31	Horace	the alt-tab
2014-11-10 17:18:41	Horace	is not perfect
2014-11-10 17:19:02	+CountryfiedLinux	People that are drawn to Linux for it's strengths are more likely to really like it than those that switch because they hate Windows.
2014-11-10 17:19:09	Horace	CountryfiedLinux: Yeah, I already heard about it
2014-11-10 17:19:22	Horace	I am trying Windows 10
2014-11-10 17:19:30	Horace	It has some benefits
2014-11-10 17:19:36	Horace	but fails at developmenmt
2014-11-10 17:19:56	Horace	With Linux, how many services do you need to run a desktop ?
2014-11-10 17:20:11	+CountryfiedLinux	I'm gonna try out Windows 10 on a display laptop at Walmart when it's out for sure.
2014-11-10 17:20:11	day|flip	lol there now calling there new os window 10 lol and 9 not out yet
2014-11-10 17:20:24	+CountryfiedLinux	Depends on what you wanna have running Horace and what desktop etc.
2014-11-10 17:20:28	Horace	dude, talking this stuff
2014-11-10 17:20:41	Horace	I am surpised no one is getting pissed
2014-11-10 17:21:20	+CountryfiedLinux	day|flip, It's because of the number 9 would cause issues with code compatibility of 95 and 98. But IMO I think marketing has more to do with it. It got people talking as you see here :)
2014-11-10 17:21:20	Horace	I have used Linux since Fedora Core 3 I think\

2014-11-10 17:33:54	+CountryfiedLinux	at least a few
