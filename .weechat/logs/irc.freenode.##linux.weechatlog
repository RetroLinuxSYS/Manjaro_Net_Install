I'd used sudo as some of the source files can't be read by me.  I tried chmod 777 with no apparent effect, nor any error messa

2014-10-27 00:47:33	Froolap	Yes there are two white spots on the bottom corner of the display that never go away because despite resolution when you tell a display that supports 65mhz to run at 60 mhz it just blows smoke and dies.
2014-10-27 00:47:49	C0MPAQ	I agree
2014-10-27 00:47:54	Viking667	A simple query. When I used to run glxgears or fgl_glxgears, I used to get frames in the 20,000-25,000 range. Now I get 300, with FPS about 60. DRI seems to be enabled, or at least ATI's version of it.
2014-10-27 00:48:01	C0MPAQ	running a display at 60MHz refresh rate will kill it

2014-10-27 00:52:17	hugaraxia	That's much much higher workload, and you'll get something more representive of more difficult processing.
2014-10-27 00:52:31	Froolap	The grub menu displays fine. Then it switches to a font that is unreadable.... later on just before it give the login prompt it seems to read what I set in /etc/default/console-setup and the font is readable again.
2014-10-27 00:52:35	hugaraxia	Other than that, you might have to go try a real benchmark. :)
2014-10-27 00:52:38	Viking667	well, I'd love to know if this card actually HAS any acceleration
2014-10-27 00:52:51	C0MPAQ	Froolap: font size depends on resolution, before the framebuffer console is loaded (if it is loaded at all in your case because it doesn't work with all cards)
2014-10-27 00:52:53	Viking667	And I've only got the one card in themachine.
2014-10-27 00:53:15	Froolap	so maybe the last 1/4 of the bootup pocess is readable.  I want to read all of it.

2014-10-27 03:28:19	sz332	we have some very weird issue, and probably you have seen something like this before. We have a service running on linux (written in java) there is an application that is connection to it's tcp/ip socket locally. What we see, is that from 1000 cases 999 times the app is able to connect, but 1 times it times out (7+seconds) by some reason. Any idea why it could happen?

2014-10-27 09:35:28	rgr	cross posting is totalyl fine in IRC. Stop nannying. There are different people giving different answers most of the time. You can then filter the best info. This isnt the same as cross posting to newsgroups.

On Unix-like systems, renaming is an atomic operation, and thus the symlink “change” will be atomic too. $ ln -s new current_tmp && mv -Tf current_tmp current

2014-10-27 11:07:23	scepticulous	I am currently thinking about deploying ecdsa for https tls deployments. Until today i avoid dsa and ecdsa due to the risk that implementation or usage errors could lead to reuse of "k" and thus reveal the private key. One might argue, that one can use it until there is such a bug in openssl or the software that uses it (nginx/apache) and react. Any opinions ?

2014-10-27 20:15:01	bsdbeard	well find out :)

2014-10-27 20:15:04	coderego	one point with PAE is that it will still limit you to 4gb ram per process

Everyone's first answer is "deleted open file handle" but those actually aren't the symptoms of that. And there are no deleted open file handles.

2014-10-30 15:15:43	n_blownapart	^the odd thing is that with no alias , bash puts the app in the background at times, and at others I lose the prompt and hitting control c closes sublime.

2014-10-30 18:42:28	soixante	basically I need an up-to-date kernel (3.2 - debian stable - is too low) but I’d like to use GNOME3. the problem is in debian test / debian unstable , they decided to switch to xfce. since i detest xfce, i think using test or unstable is a bad idea. since if they are testing it using xfce, and i use gnome, there’s a high chance something is going to break.

2014-10-30 19:42:08	Stanley00	oeri: 840F is not enough to find in hex editor. You should get more opcode around that

2014-10-30 19:47:50	kerneloopz	yes

It outputs to screen (and works locally) but via curl/wget + xinetd i get issues with connection reset by peer. Maybe due to http headers ? i dunno.

In OSX its taken 24hrs and counting to extract this using "tar -xf file.tar.gz". Is there a faster option? Any way to inspect whats inside the tarball first and only extract some of it? I think there are tarballs inside of tarballs.

2014-10-31 02:28:06	ssddx	sort of like the different win versions?
2014-10-31 02:28:15	kerneloopz	yeah, a bit
2014-10-31 02:28:20	kerneloopz	think of it like a car

2014-10-31 02:29:20	kerneloopz	yes, but I think it's pretty accurate
2014-10-31 02:29:24	ssddx	hmm
2014-10-31 02:29:39	ssddx	is one noticibly better than the others? or just all about the same
2014-10-31 02:29:52	kerneloopz	what is your definition of better?

2014-10-31 07:40:11	BigShip	bynarie: actually I just sort of accidentally figured out how to do it. If you install grub onto the partition that you installed linux to, update grub once you've finished installing, and then set the SSD and not windows bootloader as the first disk, grub should recognize the Windows 8 bootloader and allow you to boot to windows
2014-10-31 07:40:13	bynarie	when i set to use just uefi, linux wont load.. screen just stays black no matter the distro

2014-10-31 07:42:24	BigShip	Psi-Jack: I know, but UEFI support on linux is not exactly fleshed out yet. So essentially replacing the Windows bootloader that way seems like the most effective way to dual boot. The newest grub supports booting to a UEFI windows install

I see in /etc/sudoers.d that there is a file with contents "ec2-user        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL"  which would explain the nopasswd to root

2014-11-01 17:36:46	richac	which is how it relates to gaming
2014-11-01 17:37:04	richac	I guess you think google does it or no reason,  and everyone is adopting it for no reason too
2014-11-01 17:37:05	pingfloyd	peterpacz1: I'm by no means a legal document writer though, it's just a little bit of awareness of what they do, helps.
2014-11-01 17:37:17	MrElendig	richac: how does that affect spam comming from eg yahoo?

2014-11-01 17:37:39	richac	google can't disable a yahoo mail account,  but they sure can disable a gmail one.

2014-11-01 17:38:24	pingfloyd	peterpacz1: if it is a legal document, you should have someone with legal expertise look at it, or at the very least someone that has a lot of education in legal.

2014-11-01 17:39:25	peterpacz1	pingfloyd: Of course, it would be unimaginable for a person to ask someone over IRC to review an actual legal document.
2014-11-01 17:39:33	pingfloyd	peterpacz1: my limited knowledge helps when I need to communicate with the document writer.  Having a little bit of point of reference always goes a long way in bridging things.

2014-11-01 17:39:53	MrElendig	richac: because of my earlier comment about how little spam you get from non-gmail addresses in your gmail account

2014-11-01 17:40:06	MrElendig	richac: and that is all due to the filtering, and nothing to do with the phone requirement
2014-11-01 17:40:14	richac	MrElendig: do you not realize banning their own emails,   has had a huge impact?

2014-11-01 17:40:25	richac	MrElendig: do you think every compoany adopting these methods is doing it for no reason?

2014-11-02 01:36:28	edge226	mchelen1: I know right? I've been absolutely loving it after switching from geany. It took a little bit of a workflow change but It certainly feels more efficient to get things done.
2014-11-02 01:37:20	disappointment	I have a semi-interesting problem. I'd like to secure my SSH and I thought about IP-whitelisting root login and allowing other users to login only with SSH key. Oh, and I do not have physical access to the server. Two questions - can I theoretically lose access to SSH if series of some magical accidents would happen? And two, would anyone recommend anything else?
2014-11-02 01:37:23	letsgofightdrago	Yes, dokdor.
2014-11-02 01:37:55	letsgofightdrago	Test it.

2014-11-02 01:39:50	edge226	disappointment: pretty much the only "magical accident" that I could think of would be deleting the config files. I would just blacklist root login completely then su to root if needed.
2014-11-02 01:40:28	DOKDOR	yeah. il play around a bit and figure it out
2014-11-02 01:40:37	edge226	mchelen1: at first I was not too impressed with the atom editor due to unfamiliarity but it really grows on you.

2014-11-02 15:31:19	sw0rdfish	DadFoundMy edge226, but I remember reading chrome is based on chromium, so shouldn't google be obliged to make chrome open-source?

Buy an USB-Stick or a laptop with Linux preinstalled and use a convenient distro like Ubuntu, Mint or Elementary. Then, the Linux ecosystem would expand greatly, as most consumer software (think Photoshop, Maya, Games) would be ported/written for Linux.

2014-11-02 16:33:13	sabrehagen	hey guys, i have a binary started via my ~/.profile file and backgrounded (namely "./mybinary &"). however, when my session logs off, my binary isn't terminated. the desired functionality is to just start the binary when the session starts, and kill the binary when the session ends. obviously i'm doing something wrong. how do i achieve this functionality?
