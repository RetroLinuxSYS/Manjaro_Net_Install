2014-10-26 13:15:06	Dmitry-Rasputin	Sup man how have you been 
2014-10-26 13:24:29	CountryfiedLinux	Pretty good you?
2014-10-26 13:25:20	Dmitry-Rasputin	Ah fine been playing around with i3 and for some reason this very simplistic WM has stolen my soul LOL
2014-10-26 13:25:49	CountryfiedLinux	I'm more of a mouser I suppose :P
2014-10-26 13:26:22	CountryfiedLinux	Although I prefer keyboard shortcuts for screen edge tiling and menu launching.
2014-10-26 13:28:00	Dmitry-Rasputin	Yeah I honestly though that too until I literally forced myself to use it after the first day of learning keyboard commands now I love it.  I use a browser called Conkeror that allows me to surf the web even without ever touching my mouse.  Granted the mouse is here in i3 for those who want it.
2014-10-26 13:29:15	CountryfiedLinux	I'm considering a switch to Gnome and disabling the top bar and using cairo dock
2014-10-26 13:29:55	Dmitry-Rasputin	If you were going to do that why not just use MATE?
2014-10-26 13:30:28	CountryfiedLinux	Well, Cairo Dock looks best with Gnome IMO.
