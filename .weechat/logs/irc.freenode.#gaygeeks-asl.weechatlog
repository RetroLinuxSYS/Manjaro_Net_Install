2014-11-02 20:40:59	GeekDrew	i have _many_ policies in my environment, and i've never seen anything even 1/10th of that
2014-11-02 20:41:00	orbi	GeekDrew: offline files, a feature he wanted, for one.
2014-11-02 20:41:11	GeekDrew	wtf does that have to do with anything

2014-11-02 20:42:27	GeekDrew	anyone causing anything resembling "per workstation drive mappings" needs to be summarily executed
2014-11-02 20:43:30	laurence	somewhere i have a copy of the official iranian procedure for stoning to death

2014-11-02 20:43:42	orbi	why would you have something like that
2014-11-02 20:43:46	GeekDrew	laurence: excellent; thanks
2014-11-02 20:43:57	laurence	orbi: i dunno
2014-11-02 20:44:02	GeekDrew	orbi: because of incompetent ADDS admins
2014-11-02 20:44:03	orbi	im assuming you're not talking about people ODing on pot
2014-11-02 20:44:06	laurence	it came across something or other
2014-11-02 20:44:15	laurence	orbi: uh, no

2014-11-02 20:44:42	orbi	due to bad switches not passing ICMP over 512

2014-11-02 20:51:08	z2e	going trick-or-treating.. let along chaperoned by auntie is definitely weird
2014-11-02 20:51:19	Comnenus	even wearing a costume for the hell of it is fine.  But...going trick or treating?  adults?

2014-11-02 20:51:42	Comnenus	mmk.  just making sure I'm not the weird one in this situation.
2014-11-02 20:51:53	laurence	i don't think i'd give candy if two adults rang my doorbell
2014-11-02 20:52:22	Comnenus	"adults"
2014-11-02 20:52:33	Comnenus	the 18 year old is ehhh.... debatable.
2014-11-02 20:52:53	GeekDrew	eh, i know plenty of ~20 year olds who _appear_ to be early teens
2014-11-02 20:52:58	GeekDrew	but.... good grief.
2014-11-02 20:53:07	Comnenus	he acts like an early teen, too.
