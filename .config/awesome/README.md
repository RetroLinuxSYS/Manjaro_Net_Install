AwesomeWM Theme Configs and Modules

Below are the files that I personally use and that are configured with this theme.
You may change these as you wish but keep in mind the theme may not work or will be buggy unless you change the applications in the rc.lua or use my defaults.

Urxvt - can be installed in Arch/Manjaro via pacman -S rxvt-unicode
dmenu
weechat
smplayer
ogg123 - can be installed in Arch/Manjaro via pacman -S vorbis-tools (Needed for Login/out Audio)
mpd (Needed for the Audio Player module) ** Once you install mpd remember to edit its config file
mpc (Needed for Next/Foward/Play/Pause/Stop functions for keyboard and panel)
i3lock (Needed for lock screen)
scrot (Needed for screenshot)
xcompmgr (Needed for transparancy)
mutt (E-mail terminal client)
mlocate (Needed for search feature)
